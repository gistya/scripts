    :summary: AI-generated written content.

When you are inspecting written works, such as poetry, star charts, or treatises on
technological evolution, this tool will generate and display actual examples of written
text based on the in-game description.

The text is generated by an online AI service, which you have to register for. See below
for required setup.

``enable gpt``
==============
Enables the plugin. The overlay will be shown when a knowledge item or unit view sheet is open.

``disable gpt``
===============
Disables the plugin.

Required online account setup
-----------------------------

1. [Register for a free trial or paid OpenAI API account](https://openai.com/product).
2. Generate an API token for your account.
3. Save your OpenAI API token to a file `oaak.txt` in the dfhack_config directory at the root of your DF directory.
4. Install python. We used version 3.11 installed from the Microsoft Store.
5. Install python dependencies Flask and OpenAI: `pip install Flask` and `pip install OpenAI`.
6. Start the local helper python app: cd into dfhack/scripts directory & run `python srv/gptserver.py`.

Once the python helper is running, you may now enable and use the gpt plugin.

The python script defaults to using the fast, cheap, legacy model `text-davinci-003`.
If you wish to use the slower, more expensive `gpt-3.5-turbo` or `gpt-4` models, you
can start the script with `python srv/gptserver.py -gpt3` or `python srv/gptserver.py -gpt4`.
Tweaking additional OpenAI API parameters will require modifying `gptserver.py` to suit
your particular needs.

Please refer to https://openai.com/pricing for current pricing information. As of Aug. 2023,
the price for a request/response using `-gpt3` mode would be expected to be two to three cents, &
OpenAI offers a free $5 trial API credit for 90 days when you first register.
